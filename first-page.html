			<h1>I haven't forgotten about this!</h1>
			<p>The last version of this doc had a bunch of code in it I didn't write. I didn't even know it was there, but Ashli figures that since I created the .html doc in TextEdit, the settings probably defaulted to include some rich text styling or something, and I'm not really interested in chasing a different explanation.</p>
			<p>I haven't figured out how to launch a file in Sublime from the terminal yet, but I don't want to let that hold me back anymore either, so I am just navigating to Sublime from the finder for now until that's all setted. I tried following instructions from this site https://gist.github.com/barnes7td/3804534, but didn't succeed til the end and then got too overwhelmed in Stack Overflow to keep digging. Help?</p>
			<p >Anyway, I cut everything from the original document that I didn't recognize from my HTML/CSS practice on Codecademy, and will now use re-writing it to get a new commit in. I'm many many days of commits behind. Whoops. </p>
			<p>Instead of "Hello World, aka Andrew!," this paragraph in the body of this .html doc serves to list what I did programming-wise last week instead of making commits on github:
				<li>Repeadedly ran a script from the terminal to simulate a track recording in Genymotion</li>
				<li>Followed instructions to install the ffmpeg software from the terminal</li>
				<li>Ran conversions of video files created in Genymotion in the .webm format to .mp4 using ffmpeg</li>
				<li>Did I mention I'm a wizard at navigating through my file system in the terminal yet?</li>
